ReadMe Mouse Study 

The first conclusion we can draw is that only the drugs Ramicane and Capomulin were the only drugs that were highly sucessful. 
I am drawing this conclusion based on the fact the mean tumor size was substantially lower than the rest of the drugs.
Most importantly, the mean tumor size was much smaller than the placebo. This is a substantial fact because it proves these treatments are 
more effective than a "dummy" test group. The STD and Var were also lower which shows a more concentrated grouping of results which also points to a higher 
likeyhood of sucess. 

The second conclusion we can draw from this study is that there is a positive correlation between weight and tumor volume as seen in the scatter plots and 
the linear regression. this means if Mouse had a higher weight the tumor was more likey to have a larger volume. This makes sense as tumor weight is most likey accounted in the 
overall weight of the mouse at multiple weigh points. 

The last conclusion we can draw is that the study reach model proves to be highly scientific. I bring this up as there is an even distrobution of Mouse Sexes (nearly a 50/50 sample of manles 
and females the actual distrobution is a 50.2/49.8 distrobution Males/ females), as well as a distrobution of drugs given to mice(almost each drug and placebo was tested on 25 mice with 
the exception of Stelasyn which had 24; however this diffence is almost negligable prehaps a female mouse in the Stelasyn group died durring the "set up" stage of the study). 
This sort of set up is important as we could have recieved a bias of tumor growth in one of the sexes or drug groups due to under or over representations in the genders or drug sampling groups.
